sp.msg.authn-according-loa-eidas.desc=Authentication within the \
    European eID-collaboration is divided into three different "assurance \
    levels" stating how secure a particular authentication method is, where \
    "low" is the lowest level, followed by "substantial" and finally "high" \
    for the most secure methods.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa-high=Your authentication was \
    made according to eIDAS assurance level "High".
sp.msg.authn-according-loa-low=Your authentication was \
    performed according to eIDAS assurance level "Low". 
sp.msg.authn-according-loa-substantial=Your authentication was \
    made according to eIDAS assurance level "Substantial".
sp.msg.authn-according-loa.desc=The Agency for Digital \
    Government defines three "assurance levels" for authentication, 2, 3 and \
    4. These levels can be used to determine the strength of an \
    authentication, where 4 is the most secure. In order for an identity \
    provider to include such a level in an identity assertion it must have \
    been approved by the Agency for Digital Government according to that level.

    performed according to assurance level 2.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa2-nonresident=Your authentication was \

    Swedish identity number.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa2-uncertified=The identity provider \
    reports that the authentication was performed according to an \
    authentication method corresponding to assurance level 2. The identity \
    provider is not approved to deliver identity assertions according to \
    official assurance level 2 (as defined by the Agency for Digital \
    Government). Therefore, the identity assertion contains a self-declared \
    assertion of the authentication strength.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa3=Your authentication was \
    performed according to assurance level 3.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa3-nonresident=Your authentication was \

    identified user (you) is not a resident in Sweden and does not have a \
    Swedish identity number.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa3-uncertified=The identity provider \
    reports that the authentication was performed according to an \
    authentication method corresponding to assurance level 3. The identity \
    provider is not approved to deliver identity assertions according to \
    official assurance level 3 (as defined by the Agency for Digital \
    Government). Therefore, the identity assertion contains a self-declared \
    assertion of the authentication strength.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa4=Your authentication was \
    performed according to assurance level 4.
sp.msg.authn-according-loa4-nonresident=Your authentication was \
    performed according to assurance level 4 with the exception that the \
    identified user (you) is not a resident in Sweden and does not have a \
    Swedish identity number.
sp.msg.authn-according-non-notified=The identity provider by \
    whom you authenticated may not be notified according to an eIDAS scheme. A \
    "notified identity provider" is an identity provider that has been audited \
    and approved by other membership countries. However, also identity \
    providers not audited by the European commission may deliver identity \
    assertions within the eIDAS federation. For your authentication we did not \
    receive specific information whether the authentication was performed by a \
    notified or an non-notified identity provider.
sp.msg.authn-according-notified=The identity provider at \
    which you authenticated is notified according to an eIDAS eID scheme. This \
    means that the identity provider has been audited and approved by other \
    membership countries in governance of the European commission.
sp.msg.authn-according-uncertified-eidas=The eIDAS assertion was \
    delivered by an intermediate identity provider (proxy). DIGG does not take \
    any responsibility for this assertion since it has been processed by a \
    third party.
sp.msg.authn-button=Test my eID
sp.msg.authn-eidas-test=This was a eIDAS test \
    authentication.
sp.msg.authn-eidas-test.desc=Note: The assertion issued \
    is for a test person and can not be used to anything else than to test \
    eIDAS connectivity.
sp.msg.cancel=You cancelled the \
    authentication.

    authentication request.

    active, please start again.
sp.msg.error.not-found=The requested resource \
    could not be found.
sp.msg.error.response-processing=The processing of the \
    authentication response message reported errors.
sp.msg.help1.text1a=You can read more about \
    eIDAS at
sp.msg.help1.text1b=and at the
sp.msg.help1.text1c=EU site about eID and eIDAS
#
# Help texts
#
sp.msg.help1.title=What is eIDAS?
sp.msg.help2.text1=If you succeeded to \
    authenticate to this service, but you still does not get access to the \
    Swedish e-service where you use your eID it may depend on:
sp.msg.help2.text2=Many Swedish e-services \
    requires that an identity assertion (that is issued as part of your \
    authentication) contains a Swedish personal identity number. If you do not \
    have a Swedish personal identity number, or if you have one but there is \
    no binding between your eIDAS ID (displayed above) and the personal \
    identity number, some Swedish e-services may not be able to offer you the \
    service you are trying to reach.  
sp.msg.help2.text3=There are three deferent \
    assurance levels defined within the eIDAS-cooperation; "low", \
    "substantial" and "high". If your authentication is performed according to \
    a lower level that what is required by the e-service you will not be \
    granted access to the service you are trying to reach.
sp.msg.help2.title=My eID works fine here, \
    but not at the service I am trying to reach!
sp.msg.hok-button=Use Holder-of-key
sp.msg.hok-or-plain.1=The Identity Provider you \
    have selected supports authentication using both the ordinary \
    "WebSSO-profile" and the more secure "Holder-of-key profile".
sp.msg.hok-or-plain.2=If you select \
    "Holder-of-key", you will be prompted to use a digital certificate when \
    authenticating. In these cases you need to possess a certificate matching \
    what is required by the Identity Provider. Otherwise authentication will \
    not be possible.
