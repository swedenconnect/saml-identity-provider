/**
 * The {@code AttributeReleaseManager} is an {@link AttributeProducer} configured with a list of
 * {@link AttributeProducer}s and a list of {@link AttributeReleaseVoter}s. The manager will first invoke all
 * {@link AttributeProducer}s and for all attributes released invoke the {@link AttributeReleaseVoter}s.
 * <p>
 * The logic concerning the list of {@link AttributeReleaseVoter}s is as following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If any of the voters vote {@link AttributeReleaseVote#DONT_INCLUDE} the attribute will not be released,</li>
 * <li>else, if at least of voter vote {@link AttributeReleaseVote#INCLUDE} the attribute will be released,</li>
 * <li>and finally, if all voters vote {@link AttributeReleaseVote#DONT_KNOW} the attribute will not be released.</li>
 * </ul>
