 * Since Spring have deprecated the use of {@code WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter} and thinks that the setup of a
 * {@link SecurityFilterChain} should be component based, we have lost the easy way of modifying a Spring Security
 * configuration without having to dig really deep into how a particular feature is configured. So, we introduce the
 * {@link Saml2IdpConfigurerAdapter} that may be implemented in order to make adjustments to the default SAML IdP
 * settings.
 * <p>
 * Implement any number of {@link Saml2IdpConfigurerAdapter} instances and have them registered as beans. After that
 * {@code Import} the {@link Saml2IdpConfiguration} class and a SAML IdP {@link SecurityFilterChain} is created.
