/**
 * An {@code ImplicitRequestedAttribute} is used to represent a requested attribute when the requirement is "implicit",
 * meaning that it is not explicitly stated in an {@code AuthnRequest} or {@link EntityDescriptor}.
 * <p>
 * The Swedish eID framework defines "service entity categories", that when declared by a Service Provider, states
 * requirements regarding requested attributes. This is an implicit requirement about which attributes a SP wishes to
 * receive. The problem here is that attributes are grouped together in "attribute sets", and a SP may declare more than
 * one service entity category, and an IdP may deliver attributes according to one or more service entity category.
 * Therefore, if a SP declared more than one service entity category and the IdP supports both, we can not state that
 * all attributes are "required", even though the are required within its service entity category. It's poor design from
 * the beginning, and we have to handle it in the best way we can.
 * <p>
